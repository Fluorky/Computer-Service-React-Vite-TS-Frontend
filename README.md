## Project Basis
This TypeScript project is based on an earlier version developed using React and JavaScript. The previous version of the project can be found in this repository: React Computer Service App Frontend.

The TypeScript version aims to improve type safety and developer experience by leveraging TypeScript's features. Key improvements and changes in this version include:

**Type Safety:** TypeScript provides static type checking at compile time, which helps catch errors early in the development process.

**Improved Developer Experience:** With TypeScript, developers get better autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring capabilities in their IDEs.

**Modern Build Tool:** Vite offers a faster and more efficient development server with hot module replacement (HMR), making the development process smoother.

## Previous Version
The previous version of this project was built using React and JavaScript. It served as the foundation for the current TypeScript version, providing a functional and tested codebase to build upon. The repository for the old version can be found [here](https://github.com/Fluorky/Computer-Service-React-Frontend).
